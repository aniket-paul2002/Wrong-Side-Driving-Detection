# Wrong-Side-Driving-Detection
This repository contains the code and resources for a wrong side driving detection model. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect instances of wrong side driving, which is a serious issue that poses a significant threat to road safety.
Project Overview
The project focuses on training a machine learning model to detect wrong side driving using GPS coordinates (longitude and latitude) and vehicle direction as input features.
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled instances of wrong side driving incidents.
The main machine learning algorithm utilized in this project is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
The data preprocessing steps include splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, standardizing the feature matrices using the StandardScaler, and creating feature matrix and label vectors.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the performance of the model.
